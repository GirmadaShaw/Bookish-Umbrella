 This website is made using Flask , SQLAlchemy , HTML, CSS and a little bit of JAVASCRIPT.
 We have also deployed a model which could detect your emotions and recommed a book. 
 This CNN model is trained on 32,887 different expressions of humans being classified into 6 categories, namely, ANGRY , SURPRISED, HAPPY, SAD, DISGUST, NEUTRAL.
